# COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray (CXR) Scans using Transfer Learning (VGG-16, DenseNet201)

- This repository is for our B. Tech major project. In this project, we are trying to predict whether a person has COVID-19 from their Chest X-Ray *(CXR)* scan by image classification using Transfer Learning with the pre-trained models VGG-16 and DenseNet201 with ImageNet weights.
